# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I did a lot of it with a partner and it was helpful explaining things aloud because it reinforced the material. I feel like I have a good handle on the applications of methods and how to execute them. Repetition will be helpful using new variations of methods and exploring what abilities there are with each different data type. 

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - Methods are a packaged set of directions or instructions that, once defined, can be called upon many times. 
    - Their return values can be stored in variables. 
    - We can define our own methods to solve specific or unique problems in whatever it is we might be working on.
